# `apt-repo`

`apt-repo` very oddly-structured program to create and host a repo on your computer. It was originally structured like this to keep thigas as dependency-free as possible; Docker is used for the main functionailty. This should be built and installed with [`debpacker`](https://github.com/zmarffy/debpacker).

Docs to come in the future.

Needs: A way to remove DEBs from the repo; a way to host multiple repos; a way to guess codename.
