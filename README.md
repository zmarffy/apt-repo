# `apt-repo`

`apt-repo` very oddly-structured program to create and host a repo on your computer. It was originally structured like this to keep things as as dependency-free as possible, as Docker is used for the main functionailty. This should be built and installed with [`debpacker`](https://github.com/zmarffy/debpacker).

Needs: Docs; a way to remove DEBs from the repo; a way to update GPG keys; better error-handling.
